# Rick Search Tool – Head First OOA&D (Chapter 1)

This project is an implementation of the **Rick Search Tool** example from  
**Chapter 1 of _Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design_**.

The goal of this program is to demonstrate the transition from a poorly designed solution to a more **object-oriented, flexible, and maintainable design** by applying basic OOA&D principles.

## Chapter Focus

Chapter 1 focuses on:
- How to write great software
- Understanding real-world problems before coding
- Identifying why early designs break easily
- Introducing the need for abstraction, encapsulation and delegation
- Seeing how requirements changes affect bad designs

## What This Program Does

- Stores guitars with different attributes (builder, model, type, wood, etc.)
- Allows searching for guitars based on flexible criteria
- Demonstrates how separating **what varies** from **what stays the same** improves design

## Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Thinking
- Encapsulation
- Delegation
- Avoiding rigid designs
- Preparing code for changing requirements
- Basic domain modeling

## Project Purpose

This project is part of my personal practice while studying **Head First OOA&D**, where I:
- Implement chapter examples
- Experiment with design improvements
- Reinforce OOP and design principles through code

## Reference

- Book: **Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design**
- Chapter: **Chapter 1 – Well-Designed Apps Rock**
