# Doug's Dog Door – Head First OOA&D (Chapter 2)

This project is an implementation of the **Doug's Dog Door** example from  
**Chapter 2 of _Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design_**.

The goal of this program is to demonstrate **gathering requirements, writing use cases, and identifying main and alternate paths** while designing a simple system in an object-oriented way.

## Chapter Focus

Chapter 2 focuses on:
- Gathering requirements from real-world scenarios
- Writing clear use cases
- Identifying main success paths and alternate paths
- Understanding system responsibilities and actors
- Laying the groundwork for flexible design in future chapters

## What This Program Does

- Simulates a dog door that can be opened or closed using a remote control
- Demonstrates a simple main use case: pressing the remote to let the dog out and then closing the door
- Illustrates alternate paths: e.g., pressing the remote when the door is already open
- Shows the separation of actors (remote) from the system (dog door)

## Concepts Practiced

- Object-Oriented Thinking
- Encapsulation
- Responsibility-driven design
- Modeling main and alternate use case paths
- Understanding actor-system interactions
- Preparing code for future enhancements

## Project Purpose

This project is part of my personal practice while studying **Head First OOA&D**, where I:
- Implement chapter examples
- Explore requirements and use case analysis
- Reinforce object-oriented principles through simple scenario-based coding

## Reference

- Book: **Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design**
- Chapter: **Chapter 2 – Give them what they want**
